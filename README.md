# Patterns-in-Java


Welcome to the Pattern Printing Repository! This repository contains code files that demonstrate various interesting patterns using Java programming language. 

Each code file is dedicated to a specific pattern, including the butterfly, diamond shape, and different variations of star and number patterns,as well as solid and hollow rhombus patterns.

## Patterns

1. Butterfly Pattern:[butterfly.java]
   - This program prints a beautiful butterfly pattern using asterisks (*).
   - Example output:
     ```
          *        *
          **      **
          ***    ***
          ****  ****
          **********
          **********
          ****  ****
          ***    ***
          **      **
          *        *
            
     ```

2. Diamond Shape Pattern: [diamond.java]
   - This program prints a diamond shape pattern using spaces and asterisks (*).
   - Example output:
     ```
            *
          * * *
        * * * * *
      * * * * * * *
        * * * * *
          * * *
            *
     ```

3. Star Patterns:[star_pattern.java]
   - This program demonstrates different star patterns such as the right triangle, left triangle, and pyramid.
   - Example output (right triangle):
     ```                                                  
     *
     * *                  
     * * *
     * * * *
     * * * * *
     ```
```
            *
          * *
        * * *
      * * * *
    * * * * *
 ``` 
 ```
       * 
      * *
     * * *
    * * * *
   * * * * *
   ```
   
4. Number Patterns: [numbers.java]
   - This program showcases various number patterns including the number pyramid and number staircase.
   - Example output (number pyramid):
     ```
           1
          2 2
         3 3 3
        4 4 4 4
       5 5 5 5 5
     ```
 #Flyod's Triangle

11 12 13 14 15

```

# 0-1 pattern
```

1 0 1
0 1 0 1
1 0 1 0 1

```
 
# palindromic numbers print

```
    1
   212
  32123
 4321234
543212345

```
  5. Solid and Hollow Rhombus Patterns:[rhombus.java]
   - Solid Rhombus: 
     - This program prints a solid rhombus pattern using asterisks (*).
     - Example output:
       ```
           *****
          *****
         *****
        *****
       *****
       ```

   - Hollow Rhombus: 
     - This program prints a hollow rhombus pattern using spaces and asterisks (*).
     - Example output:
       ```
           *****
          *   *
         *   *
        *   *
       *****
       ```

Feel free to explore each code file to understand the logic behind the patterns and run them in your Java development environment.
