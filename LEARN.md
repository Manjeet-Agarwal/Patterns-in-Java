# Learn Pattern Printing in Java

Welcome to the Pattern Printing Learning Guide! This guide accompanies the Pattern Printing Repository, which contains code files demonstrating various interesting patterns using the Java programming language. Each code file is dedicated to a specific pattern, including the butterfly, diamond shape, different variations of star and number patterns, as well as solid and hollow rhombus patterns.

## How to Use

1. Clone the Repository: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine using the following command:

https://github.com/Manjeet-Agarwal/Patterns-in-Java.git


2. Explore the Patterns: Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the `patterns-in-java` directory. You will find the following code files:
- [butterfly_pattern.java](butterfly_pattern.java)
- [diamond.java](diamond.java)
- [star_patterns.java](star_patterns.java)
- [number_patterns.java](number_patterns.java)
- [rhombus.java](rhombus.java)

3. Run the Code: Open each code file in your preferred Java development environment or text editor. Take a moment to review the code and understand the logic behind each pattern. Then, compile and run the code to see the pattern in action. You can modify the code to experiment with different variations of the patterns or customize them according to your preferences.

4. Experiment and Customize: Once you have familiarized yourself with the code files, feel free to experiment and customize the patterns according to your preferences. You can modify the code to change the size, shape, or design of the patterns. Use your creativity to create unique variations of the patterns or combine multiple patterns to create something new.

5. Contribute: If you have ideas for additional patterns or improvements to the existing code, we encourage you to contribute to this repository. You can open an issue to discuss your suggestions or submit a pull request with your changes.

I hope this learning guide helps you explore the fascinating world of pattern printing in Java. Enjoy discovering and creating beautiful patterns!
